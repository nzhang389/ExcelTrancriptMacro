# ExcelTranscriptMacro

I created this macro while working as a technical intern for Dr. Guo at CSU East Bay during the summer of 2014. 

This macro reads through a students transcript to determine graduation eligibility. It works by reading a "VVV" on the first sheet and the corresponding number to represent that sections requirements (read from the resources sheets). Then it iterates through the transcript to find matching classes and copies the classes and any related data (grade, quarter taken) onto the major check sheet.

Extra functionalities: Since a class is not allowed to be used to satisfy two different requirements, there will be no repeats on the major check sheet. It will display the highest grades in the possible class requirements and then alphabetize them before showing them on the Major Check sheet.
